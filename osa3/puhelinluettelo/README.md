# Programming a server with NodeJS and Express

In this part, I learned
- to implement functionality on the server side of the stack (backend :) )
- to implement a simple REST API in Node.js by using the Express library
- to store application's data in MongoDB database
- to deploy application to the internet

Project in this part: Phonebook (continues from the Part Two)
