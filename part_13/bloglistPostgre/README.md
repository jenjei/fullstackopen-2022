# Bloglist Postgre App

This is the backend done with PostgreSQL database, fly.io, Node.

During this part I learned
- to connect relational database to web application
- to use psql console
- Sequelize (model querying etc)

This app 

## Notes for future self

- To fix eslint errors: ```npm run lint -- --fix```
- Sequalize documentation https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/
- If fly.io server is not working, best/ quickest solution is to create new one (delete fly.toml and run fly launch on CLI)
