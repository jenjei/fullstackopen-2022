# What was hard? How could I improve my skills?

Debugging is hard from time to time. It should improve over time. I suppose. Love the problem not the solution :) I learned to use console.log basically everywhere. I didn't use debuggers much, so there is still something to learn about debugging.

Backend: authentication and data modeling/routing through http.

Testing was completely new area for me. And challenging task to do sometimes. Definetely would like to learn more.
