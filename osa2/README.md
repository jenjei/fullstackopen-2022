# Communicating with Server


In this part, I learned
- how to render a data collection
- how a user can submit data to a React application using HTML forms
- how JavaScript code in the browser can fetch and handle data stored in a remote backend server
- how to add CSS styles to our React applications

Hardest part for me was to render weather icons for Countries Project.


### Project: Kurssitiedot (Course Info)


Continued developing Course Info (same one as in part One).

I learned how to render a data collection.


### Project: Maatiedot (Countries)


Countries App displays a list of countries (from API) with a search field. Country details (such as population, capital, weather) is shown when search result is left to one country.

I learned how to fetch data from API and how to format data.


### Project: Puhelinluettelo (Phonebook)


Phonebook App enables user to save contact information (name and phonenumber), edit contact information, delete contact information. This application is still frontend app.

I learned how to alter data in server, and how a user can submit data to a React application.
